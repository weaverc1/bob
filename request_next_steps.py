        The BOB autonomous mower project has successfully completed ESP32 firmware installation.

        COMPLETED WORK:
        1. ‚úÖ Architecture review completed
        2. ‚úÖ Micro-ROS integration plan created
        3. ‚úÖ ESP32 firmware v1.3 developed with:
           - Micro-ROS integration (publishers, subscribers, executor)
           - Motor control (L298N driver)
           - Encoder reading with rollover protection
           - IMU integration (BNO086)
           - Odometry computation
           - Watchdog timer (3 second timeout)
           - cmd_vel timeout failsafe (1 second)
           - Velocity clamping and error checking
        4. ‚úÖ Firmware code review by Differential Drive Specialist
        5. ‚úÖ ESP32 Arduino Core 3.x compatibility fixes
        6. ‚úÖ Runtime errors fixed (watchdog, GPIO pullups)
        7. ‚úÖ Firmware successfully flashed to ESP32 hardware
        8. ‚úÖ Serial monitor shows normal micro-ROS handshake protocol

        CURRENT STATE:
        - ESP32 running firmware v1.3, ready for ROS2 communication
        - Raspberry Pi 4 (BOB) has hardware connected but no ROS2 yet
        - Development machine has ROS2 Jazzy, Gazebo, testbot working

        HARDWARE CONFIGURATION:
        - Development Machine: Ubuntu 24.04, ROS2 Jazzy, Gazebo simulation
        - BOB (Raspberry Pi 4): Ubuntu 24.04, IP 192.168.86.62, hardware connected
        - ESP32: Firmware v1.3, connected to Pi via USB
        - Sensors: BNO086 IMU, SLLIDAR A1/A2, wheel encoders, GPS (future)
        - Motors: Differential drive with L298N driver

        CRITICAL PATH (from architecture review):
        1. Deploy ROS2 Jazzy to BOB ‚Üê NEXT STEP?
        2. Test ESP32-ROS2 communication via micro-ROS agent
        3. Implement robot_localization EKF (sensor fusion)
        4. Configure Nav2 and SLAM Toolbox
        5. Safety system implementation

        Based on the current state and critical path, provide a detailed recommendation for the
        next steps. Consider:
        - What should be done first?
        - What can be done in parallel?
        - What are the dependencies?
        - What are the risks?
        - What is the estimated timeline?
        - Should we deploy to BOB now or test locally first?

        Provide specific, actionable next steps with clear prioritization.
