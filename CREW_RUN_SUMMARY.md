## 🎓 What You Learned From The Crew

### System Design
- Use Nav2 for navigation (industry standard)
- Use robot_localization for sensor fusion
- Implement geofencing with GPS
- Run control loop at 10 Hz
- Use costmap_2d for obstacle representation

### Safety Approach
- Emergency stop is critical (physical + software)
- Sensor redundancy for critical functions
- Watchdog timers for node monitoring
- HAZOP analysis methodology
- ISO 13849 PL d compliance needed

### Development Strategy
- Start with existing ROS2 packages
- Test incrementally (sensors → controllers → navigation)
- Use Gazebo for simulation before hardware
- Implement safety monitor node
- Plan for GPS loss scenarios
